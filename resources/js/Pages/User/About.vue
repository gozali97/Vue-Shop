                    <p class="lead">Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the utility-first
                        classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals,
                        datepickers.</p>
                    <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
                        you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
                    <p>But then I found a <a href="https://flowbite.com">component library based on Tailwind CSS called
                        Flowbite</a>. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation
                        bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from
                        Tailwind CSS.</p>

                    <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
                    <p>First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework.
                        Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the
                        documentation.</p>
                    <p>It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns,
                        and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.</p>
                    <p>You can check out the <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">quickstart
                        guide</a> to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want
                        to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can
                        purge and minify the generated CSS.</p>
                    <p>You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help
                        you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this <a
                            href="https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/">comparison table</a> to better understand
                        the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.</p>
                    <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
                    <p>While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping
                        will come in handy:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they
                            follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a
                            usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying
                            properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;</li>
                        <li><strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by
                            providing your client with a hands-on experience;</li>
                        <li><strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive medium to preview and test
                            design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Laying the groundwork for best design</h3>
                    <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
                        you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
                    <p>Let's start by including the CSS file inside the <code>head</code> tag of your HTML.</p>
                    <h3>Understanding typography</h3>
                    <h4>Type properties</h4>
                    <p>A typeface is a collection of letters. While each letter is unique, certain shapes are shared across
                        letters. A typeface represents shared patterns across a collection of letters.</p>

                    <h3>Type classification</h3>
                    <h4>Serif</h4>
                    <p>A serif is a small shape or projection that appears at the beginning or end of a stroke on a letter.
                        Typefaces with serifs are called serif typefaces. Serif fonts are classified as one of the
                        following:</p>
                    <h4>Old-Style serifs</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes</li>
                        <li>Diagonal stress in the strokes</li>
                        <li>Slanted serifs on lower-case ascenders</li>
                    </ul><img src="https://flowbite.s3.amazonaws.com/typography-plugin/typography-image-2.png" alt="">

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Flowbite is just awesome. It contains tons of predesigned components and pages starting from
                            login screen to complex dashboard. Perfect choice for your next SaaS application.</p>

                    <h3>Best practices for setting up your prototype</h3>
                    <p><strong>Low fidelity or high fidelity?</strong> Fidelity refers to how close a prototype will be to
                        the real deal. If you’re simply preparing a quick visual aid for a presentation, a low-fidelity
                        prototype — like a wireframe with placeholder images and some basic text — would be more than
                        enough. But if you’re going for more intricate usability testing, a high-fidelity prototype — with
                        on-brand colors, fonts and imagery — could help get more pointed results.</p>
                    <p><strong>Consider your user</strong>. To create an intuitive user flow, try to think as your user
                        would when interacting with your product. While you can fine-tune this during beta testing,
                        considering your user’s needs and habits early on will save you time by setting you on the right
                        path.</p>
                    <p><strong>Start from the inside out</strong>. A nice way to both organize your tasks and create more
                        user-friendly prototypes is by building your prototypes ‘inside out’. Start by focusing on what will
                        be important to your user, like a Buy now button or an image gallery, and list each element by order
                        of priority. This way, you’ll be able to create a prototype that puts your users’ needs at the heart
                        of your design.</p>
                    <p>And there you have it! Everything you need to design and share prototypes — right in Flowbite Figma.
